# LogPilot
Simplify log monitoring and analysis by providing an intuitive UI layer on top of Fluent Bit

### **Overview**

The UI wrapper will act as a management layer on top of Fluent Bit's core engine, making it easier for users to configure log collection, monitoring, and analysis without needing to understand the complex configuration syntax.

### **Feature Implementation**

### **1. Automated Log Monitoring**

The monitoring system will leverage Fluent Bit's input plugins and event handling system to automatically collect and process logs:

- **Input Plugin Management**: Automatically configure and manage input plugins based on detected applications. flb_input.c:1488-1492
- **Event Processing**: Use Fluent Bit's event handling system to process log events in real-time. flb_engine.c:1056-1060
- **Metrics Collection**: Track log volume, error rates, and performance metrics using Fluent Bit's built-in metrics system. flb_input.c:1080-1085

### **2. Intelligent Error Detection**

Implement a filtering system that only triggers alerts for genuine errors:

- **Log Pattern Recognition**: Use processors to identify error patterns in logs. flb_processor.h:33-41
- **Conditional Processing**: Apply conditional rules to filter out noise and only process actual errors. processor_conditional.sh:31-43
- **Error Classification**: Categorize errors by severity and type to enable appropriate responses.

### **3. Easy User Onboarding**

Create a streamlined onboarding process:

- **Application Discovery**: Automatically detect common application log formats and locations.
- **Configuration Wizard**: Step-by-step wizard to configure log collection with sensible defaults.
- **Template Library**: Pre-configured templates for common applications and services.
- **Visual Configuration Editor**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating and editing Fluent Bit configurations.

### **4. Event-Based Notification System**

Implement a flexible notification system:

- **Multiple Channels**: Support for email, Slack, webhook, SMS, and push notifications.
- **Customizable Rules**: Allow users to define when and how they receive notifications.
- **Notification Grouping**: Group related alerts to prevent alert fatigue.
- **Escalation Policies**: Define escalation paths for critical issues.

The notification system would leverage Fluent Bit's event handling capabilities: flb_engine.c:1108-1116

### **5. AI-Powered Root Cause Analysis**

Implement an AI system for log analysis:

- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common error patterns and their likely causes.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Connect related events across multiple services.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual patterns that may indicate problems.
- **Suggested Solutions**: Provide potential fixes based on historical data and known issues.
- **Learning System**: Improve analysis over time based on feedback and outcomes.

## **Notes**

This plan leverages Fluent Bit's core architecture while adding a user-friendly layer on top. The implementation would require building several new components that interact with Fluent Bit's engine, input/output plugins, and event handling system. The AI component would be a new addition that analyzes the log data collected by Fluent Bit to provide insights and root cause analysis.

The plan focuses on making Fluent Bit more accessible to users without deep technical knowledge of log processing while maintaining the performance and flexibility that makes Fluent Bit powerful. By automating configuration, providing intelligent filtering, and adding AI-powered analysis, the UI wrapper would significantly reduce the effort required to set up and maintain effective log monitoring.
